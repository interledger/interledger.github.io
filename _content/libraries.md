## SPSP

Build Interledger payments into your apps with the [ILP SPSP Client][1]. This library can connect to any SPSP receiver for account discovery and payment detail negotation. For more information on how to use SPSP, read ["SPSP: Simple Payment Setup Protocol"][2] on the Interledger Blog. 

## Koa ILP

If you use the [Koa framework][3] in Node.js, this library will allow you to monetize your API in only a few lines of code. For more information, [check out our Github][4] and [our blog post about it.][5]

## ILP Fetch

You can use [ILP Fetch][6] as a client to HTTP-ILP. ILP Fetch follows the [Fetch API][7], but allows the client to send payments. You can use it to interact with paid APIs on Interledger.

## Moneyd XRP

[Moneyd-XRP][8] allows you to connect to the Interledger network via XRP. It can be used on the livenet or the testnet with minimal configuration. We also have "Moneyd-ETH" and "Moneyd-Lightning" in the works.
