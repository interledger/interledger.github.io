## Who Are We?

Interledger is developed by an open group of companies and individual contributors, loosely organized as part of a Community Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). See the full list of members [here][1].

Want to build on Interledger or be part of its development?   
Here's where you can find us and get involved:

## Github

Technical discussion about the Interledger specs and reference implementation are done mainly through Github issues and pull requests. Watch the [Interledger RFCs repo][2] for updates to the specs and the projects under the [Interledger.js organization][3] for developments on the reference implementation.

## Forum

The official Interledger community forum can be found [forum.interledger.org][4]. It's the place for technical discussions related to the Interledger protocol stack, implementations, and applications built on top.

## Bi-Weekly Calls

We have open community calls **every other Wednesday at 4pm UTC** to discuss the latest in Interledger spec development, the implementations, and to answer any questions people have. Agendas are sent out via the mailing list and anyone can suggest an agenda item by adding to the [topic][5] created for that purpose in the forum. 

Recordings of previous calls are available [here][6].

## Mailing List

### W3C

All announcements, including about upcoming in-person meetings, and many technical discussions are done through the W3C Interledger Community Group Mailing List. Have ideas to share or just want to keep up with the latest developments? [Join the Community Group][7].
