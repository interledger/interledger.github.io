# Connecting to an ILP Testnet

This tutorial will help you start moneyd locally on your computer and connect it to an ILP router on the testnet.

This tutorial describes how to:

1. Configure and start [`moneyd`](https://github.com/interledgerjs/moneyd) to connect to an 
[ILP router](https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-connector) on the testnet
2. Send value to a [payment pointer](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0026-payment-pointers/) on the testnet

## Before you begin
For this tutorial, you will need `moneyd` and SPSP installed on your computer. You can learn how to install `moneyd` 
and SPSP from the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) tutorial.

NOTE: For this tutorial you do not need to use real cryptocurrency. Since you will be running ILP on a testnet node, 
funds will be used from a [testnet faucet](https://xrpl.org/xrp-test-net-faucet.html) and have no real-world value.

## Configuring moneyd
NOTE: Before configuring `moneyd`, make sure to delete the `.moneyd.test.json` config file if it already exists on 
your computer.

To configure moneyd: 

1. Open a terminal and use the following command:
```shell
moneyd xrp:configure --testnet --advanced
```

2. When prompted for the `BTP host of parent connector`, enter:
```shell
js.xpring.dev
```

3. Press enter for other default options.

## Starting moneyd
After youâ€™ve configured `moneyd`, run the following command to start it on your computer and connect it to an 
ILP router on the testnet:
```shell
moneyd xrp:start --testnet
```

If everything goes well, you should see an output similar to this:
```shell
2019-07-01T16:33:34.921Z connector:ilp-plugin-mini-accounts[local] info listening on port 7768
2019-07-01T16:33:34.924Z connector:app info connector ready (republic attitude). address=test.xpring-dev.js1.ilspServer.P7sCid1j1WzWayl2s4w8Tuu2yyBrLCqtRc9s4Umb3xg version=22.4.1
```

## Sending value
Once `moneyd` is connected to the router on the testnet, you can send value to `Alice` or `Carol`.

To send value to `Alice`, open a new terminal and run:
```shell
$ ilp-spsp send --amount 10 --receiver '$xpring.dev/alice/xrp'
```

If you were successful, you should see the following output on the sending terminal:
```shell
paying 10 to "$xpring.dev/alice/xrp"...
sent 10 units!
```
